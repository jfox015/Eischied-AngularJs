# Project Eischied

A boilerplate MEAN Stack demo for a web based, multi API application. Named after the 70's TV Shot Eisshied starting Joe Don Baker.

This library has two main components, the backend pages/API and public HTML.

The example API included is written in NodeJS using Express 4.x+ with Jade Templating.

The front end is an AngularJS based application UI using JQuery, Bootstrap and LESS CSS.

Back and forth communication from the UI to the backend is accomplished via a RESTful services API.

This project is based off the excellent Hackathon Starter Project (https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter).
